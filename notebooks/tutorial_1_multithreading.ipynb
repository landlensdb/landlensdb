    "   - 67x speedup with 10 workers vs single thread\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Built-in retry mechanism (3 attempts per image)\n",
    "   - 1-second delay between retries\n",
    "   - Failed downloads are logged but don't stop the process\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Progress Tracking**:\n",
    "   - Progress bar shows overall download progress\n",
    "   - Shows current download speed\n",
    "   - Indicates any failed downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Filename Handling**:\n",
    "   - Uses 'name' column for filenames (format: mly|{id})\n",
    "   - Results in clean filenames like 'mly_123456789.jpg'\n",
    "   - Prevents issues with long URLs as filenames"
